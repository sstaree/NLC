## 📖 Introduction
### Motivation
Multi-view data often contains noisy labels due to imperfect annotations, which misleads models and reduces classification performance. Existing methods struggle to separate and correct noisy labels during training.
### Method
The proposed Noisy Label Calibration (NLC) method includes:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;1.Cross-view Ranking Learning (CRL) – reduces heterogeneity and enhances consistency across views.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;2.Label Noise Detection (LND) – identifies noisy labels using confidence scores from reliable neighbors.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;3.Label Calibration Learning (LCL) – corrects noisy labels based on neighbor consensus.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;4.Multi-view classification – uses cross-entropy loss with a penalty term to avoid overconfidence.<br>
